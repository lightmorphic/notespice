# Notespice

A self-hosted, database-less notes app. Every note is a plain markdown
file on disk — no database, ever — with a Rust backend, a full
GitHub Flavored Markdown toolbar, and an installable PWA frontend.

> ⚠️ Vibe coded with [Claude](https://claude.ai).

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

## Features

- ✨ Clean, minimal interface with a full GitHub Flavored Markdown
  toolbar — headings, lists, tables, footnotes, GitHub-style callouts,
  the works (see [GitHub Flavored Markdown support](#github-flavored-markdown-support))
- 📝 WYSIWYG editor with a one-click raw-markdown toggle — a small
  hand-written markdown converter, not a third-party library loaded
  from a CDN, so there's nothing external to version-mismatch or break
- 🗂️ No database — every note is just a `.md` file you can open,
  edit, or move with any other tool, even while the app is running
- 📎 Images, uploads, and file attachments, stored alongside your
  notes and referenced by plain markdown links
- 🔍 Full-text search, plus instant name-filtering as you type
- 🕓 Sidebar shows your last 10 *viewed* notes first, not just
  last-edited
- ↩️ Undo/redo
- 📤 One-click export to a dated zip; import that same zip (or a loose
  `.md` file) back in, never overwriting on a title collision
- 📱 Installable PWA — works offline for the app shell, "Add to Home
  Screen" on mobile or desktop
- 🌓 Dark/light mode, following system preference
- 🔐 Argon2id password hashing, per-IP login rate limiting, and a
  handful of other deliberate security choices (see
  [Security notes](#security-notes))
- 🔤 Self-hosted [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) typeface — no Google
  Fonts CDN, no external font request of any kind

## Storage

Notespice stores notes as individual markdown files in one directory —
no database, no proprietary format. The filename *is* the note title.
Attachments live in a `files/` subfolder right alongside them. That's
the entire data model: `ls` the directory, open a note in any text
editor, back it up with `rsync`, or stop using this app entirely —
nothing is ever locked away in a format only Notespice understands.

See [Data model](#data-model) below for the full detail, including how
search, recently-viewed tracking, and attachments all fit into that
same single directory.

## Quick Start

### Running locally without Docker

Requires a reasonably current stable Rust toolchain — install via
[rustup](https://rustup.rs) if your OS package manager's version is old.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FOSSCharlie/notespice.git
cd notespice
cargo build --release
NOTES_PASSWORD=changeMe123 NOTES_DIR=./notes NOTES_DATA_DIR=./appdata ./target/release/notespice
```

Open <http://localhost:8080>. Notes are written to `./notes`, as `.md`
files, with attachments under `./notes/files`. App-only state (the
recently-viewed list) lives separately under `./appdata`.

> Note: service workers require HTTPS (`localhost` is exempt for
> testing), so offline support and "Add to Home Screen" will only work
> once this is served over TLS on a real domain.

### Using Docker

1. Pull from GitHub Container Registry (after the Actions workflow has
   published it at least once — see
   [Automatic image publishing](#automatic-image-publishing))

   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/fosscharlie/notespice:latest
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/media/notes /opt/notespice
   sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/media/notes /opt/notespice
   docker run -p 8080:8080 \
     -e NOTES_PASSWORD=changeMe123 \
     -v /opt/media/notes:/notes \
     -v /opt/notespice:/data \
     ghcr.io/fosscharlie/notespice:latest
   ```

2. Or build locally

   ```bash
   docker build -t notespice .
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/media/notes /opt/notespice
   sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/media/notes /opt/notespice
   docker run -p 8080:8080 \
     -e NOTES_PASSWORD=changeMe123 \
     -v /opt/media/notes:/notes \
     -v /opt/notespice:/data \
     notespice
   ```

3. Docker Compose

   ```yaml
   services:
     notespice:
       image: ghcr.io/fosscharlie/notespice:latest
       container_name: notespice
       restart: unless-stopped
       environment:
         NOTES_USERNAME: "admin"
         NOTES_PASSWORD: "changeMe!"
       volumes:
         - /opt/media/notes:/notes
         - /opt/notespice:/data
       ports:
         - "8080:8080"
   ```

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/media/notes /opt/notespice
   sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/media/notes /opt/notespice
   docker compose up -d
   ```

> **Note:** the container runs as a non-root user (UID/GID 1000), not
> root. After creating the data directory (or if you're upgrading an
> existing install), run the `chown` command above so the container
> can actually write to the mounted folder — without it, Notespice
> will fail to create or update notes.

Open <http://localhost:8080>. Notes (`*.md`) and attachments (`files/`)
end up under `/opt/media/notes` — that's the one directory worth
backing up. `/opt/notespice` holds only app-internal state (currently
just the recently-viewed list used for sidebar ordering) — not notes,
safe to lose, kept separate on purpose so it's never mixed in with
your actual data. The `docker-compose.yml` itself can live wherever
you keep your other compose stacks; its own location is independent
of where either of these directories is.

Put this behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik,
or Tailscale Serve) for anything beyond local testing — the `Secure`
cookie flag (on by default) requires the browser to have reached it
over HTTPS, and PWA installability requires it too.

After updating the image:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

(`docker compose up -d` alone does **not** re-pull a cached `:latest` tag.)

## Automatic image publishing

`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` builds and pushes the image to
`ghcr.io/fosscharlie/notespice` on every push to `main` (plus a weekly
scheduled rebuild, so OS-level security patches keep landing even
without a code change), using the repo's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` — no
extra secrets needed. Make sure the resulting package is set to public
in the repo's Packages tab if you want to `docker pull` it without
authenticating.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NOTES_USERNAME` | no | `admin` | Login username |
| `NOTES_PASSWORD` | **yes** | — | Login password (min. 8 characters). Hashed with Argon2id in memory at startup; never stored or logged in plaintext. |
| `NOTES_DIR` | no | `/notes` | Where `.md` files and their `files/` attachments live — the actual vault |
| `NOTES_DATA_DIR` | no | `/data` | Where app-only state lives (currently just the recently-viewed list) — not notes |
| `NOTES_PORT` | no | `8080` | Port to listen on |
| `NOTES_INSECURE_COOKIES` | no | `false` | Set to `true` **only** for local testing over plain `http://`. Never set this in production — it removes the `Secure` flag from the session cookie. |

## GitHub Flavored Markdown support

Notespice targets full [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/),
plus the callout/alert syntax GitHub's own renderer supports on top of
that spec. The toolbar covers all of it:

- Headings (1–6), bold, italic, strikethrough, inline code
- Bullet, numbered, and checkbox (task) lists, with indent/outdent for nesting
- Blockquotes, fenced code blocks, horizontal rules
- Tables
- Links, images (by URL or upload), and generic file attachments
  (inserted as a link, stored under `files/` — see
  [Data model](#data-model))
- Footnotes (`[^1]` / `[^1]: ...`), with a collected footnotes section
  rendered at the bottom of the note
- GitHub-style callouts — `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`,
  `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!CAUTION]` — rendered with the same colored-box
  treatment GitHub.com uses, not just as plain blockquote text

Every file Notespice writes is plain, spec-compliant markdown — open it
on GitHub, in another editor, or in a terminal, and it reads correctly
regardless of whether Notespice is involved at all. The editor is a
small hand-written markdown ⇄ HTML converter built specifically for
this app — no external editor library, no CDN dependency, nothing to
version-mismatch or break. It only implements the GFM subset this
toolbar exposes (listed above); anything outside that (raw HTML
embeds, non-standard extensions) round-trips as plain text rather than
being specially rendered.

## Security notes

Found a vulnerability? See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for how to
report it — the notes below are about what's already built in, not how
to disclose something new.

- Passwords are hashed with Argon2id; only the hash is ever kept in
  memory, and it's never written to disk or logged.
- Sessions are opaque random tokens held server-side — the cookie
  itself carries no information, so nothing meaningful leaks if it's
  ever captured outside of TLS.
- Login attempts are rate-limited per source IP (8 attempts per 15
  minutes) to blunt brute-force attempts.
- Every note title is passed through an allow-list sanitizer before it
  ever touches the filesystem, closing off path traversal
  (`../../etc/passwd`-style requests) at the one place all note I/O
  goes through.
- The container runs as a non-root user, and the base image's OS
  packages are patched at every build (see the CI workflow's weekly
  scheduled rebuild).
- Request bodies are capped at 5MB to blunt trivial
  resource-exhaustion attempts.

## Export / Import

**Export** (sidebar → "Export all") downloads every note and
attachment as one zip, named `YYYY-MM-DD_notes.zip` — notes at the
root as `.md` files, attachments under `files/`. It's the same shape
either way, so an export is also a valid import.

**Import** (sidebar → "Import") accepts either:
- That same `.zip` shape — every `.md` file at its root becomes a
  note, everything under `files/` becomes an attachment
- A single loose `.md` file — its filename (minus the extension)
  becomes the note title

Import never overwrites an existing note — a title that already
exists gets a `(1)`, `(2)`, etc. suffix instead: importing a note
called `note-name` when `note-name.md` already exists produces
`note-name(1).md`; import it again and you get `note-name(2).md`, and
so on. Re-importing an export you already have, in other words, adds a
duplicate copy rather than silently replacing anything. (Imported
attachments use Notespice's regular file-upload collision handling
instead — a `-2`, `-3`, etc. suffix — since that's the same code path
as a normal upload through the editor.)

## Note list order

The sidebar shows your last 10 *viewed* notes first,
most-recently-opened at the top — not last-edited. Opening a note you
don't change still brings it to the top; editing isn't required.
Reopening a note already in that list moves it back to the top rather
than duplicating it. Every other note (anything outside the last 10
viewed) falls back to last-modified order underneath.

This is tracked in a small `.recent.json` file in `NOTES_DATA_DIR` —
plain JSON, an array of up to 10 titles, most-recent-first. It's
disposable app state, not a note, which is exactly why it lives in a
separate directory from the notes themselves rather than mixed in with
your vault: deleting it just resets the sidebar to modified-time order,
nothing else is affected, and it's excluded from search, export, and
the note list itself.

## Data model

Every note is `<NOTES_DIR>/<title>.md` — a plain UTF-8 markdown file.
Anything inserted into a note — images, PDFs, any other attachment —
is uploaded to `<NOTES_DIR>/files/<name>` and referenced from the note
by a relative link, so the whole vault (text and attachments together)
is still just one bind-mounted volume: `NOTES_DIR` is the only
directory you ever need to back up. `NOTES_DATA_DIR` is a separate,
smaller directory for app-only state (see
[Note list order](#note-list-order)) — deliberately not part of the
vault, since it isn't your data.

There is no database, no hidden index file that matters (the search
index lives in memory only and rebuilds from these files on every
start), and no proprietary formatting. You can add, edit, or delete
`.md` files — or drop files directly into `files/` — while the app is
stopped (or even while it's running, though you'll need to restart to
pick up out-of-band changes, since the index isn't watching the
filesystem).

Attachment filenames go through the same allow-list sanitizer as note
titles before ever touching disk, and duplicate uploads are
disambiguated with a `-2`, `-3`, … suffix rather than overwriting.
Fetching an attachment (`GET /api/files/<name>`) requires the same
session cookie as everything else — nothing is reachable by a
logged-out visitor just because it's rendered as an `<img>` tag rather
than fetched with JavaScript. Uploads are capped at 20MB per file.

## Development

Keep it simple — this app exists specifically to be small enough to
read top to bottom: no frontend build step, no database, no dependency
that isn't earning its place. If a change makes something harder to
understand without a clear payoff, it's probably the wrong change.
